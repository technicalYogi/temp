Version 0.0.3 - Gary R. Van Sickle, 2012-01-07

* Major installation improvements:
- Reworked Autotools infrastructure to build and statically link to DParser and Boost libraries
  from source tarballs if necessary.
  Unlike in prior releases, it is no longer necessary to separately build and install DParser or Boost.
  As of 0.0.3, CoFlo will automatically build the necessary components from the libraries' source distribution tarballs.
- Libtoolized the project in order to better support different shared object linking requirements on more systems.
- Manually added a "BOOST_RPATH" configure-time variable which gets passed to libtool at link-time.
  The AX_BOOST_<...> macros don't add this automatically.
- Added build and host triples to the output of "--build-info".
